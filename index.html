    <h2>What are Greenhouse Gases?</h2>
       <h3>Greenhouse gases are gases in the air which trap heat radiated from the sun, this keeps the Earth
warm. There are many different types of gases but some of the main ones include Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrous oxide and water vapour.
Carbon dioxide can be produced through volcanic eruptions and animals/humans breathing. Methane is produced naturally as well through decomposition and cattle farming.
Water vapour the most abundant greenhouse gas, water vapour only resides in the atmosphere for a few days which is a lot less when compared to carbon dioxide which lasts for centuries.</h3>
