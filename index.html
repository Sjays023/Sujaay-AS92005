<h2>What are Greenhouse Gases?</h2>
<p>Greenhouse gases are gases in the air which trap heat radiated from the sun, which keeps the Earth
warm. There are many different types of gases, but some of the main ones include Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrous oxide and water vapour.
Carbon dioxide can be produced through volcanic eruptions and by animals/humans breathing. Methane is also produced naturally through decomposition and cattle farming.
Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, water vapor only resides in the atmosphere for a few days which is a lot less when compared to carbon dioxide which lasts for centuries.</p>

  <h2>How are humans contributing to Greenhouse Gases?</h2>
<p>
  Humans contribute to greenhouse gas emissions primarily through the use of fossil fuels,
  This includes coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity, transportation and heating, which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
  Other processes like cement and steel production also emit carbon dioxide, while some manufacturing activities release powerful synthetic greenhouse gases like hydrofluorocarbons used in
  refrigeration and air conditioning. Agriculture contributes to the problem primarily through livestock farming, which produces methane during the digestion process in cows.
  Humans have also increased the amount of deforestation for farming land and development, which reduces the amount of trees that absorb carbon dioxide, further increasing the atmospheric greenhouse gas levels.
  These human activities have intensified the natural greenhouse effect, resulting in a greater contribution to global warming and climate change.
