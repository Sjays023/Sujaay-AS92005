        <h1>How Greenhouse gases affect the earth</h1>
        <p>
            Greenhouse gases affect the Earth by trapping heat in the atmosphere. When sunlight reaches Earth, some of it is absorbed by the land and oceans, and the rest is reflected back into space as heat. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap some of that heat and prevent it from escaping, making the planet warmer.
            <br><br>
            One major effect of this is that the ice in the polar regions and mountain glaciers is melting much faster than before. This causes sea levels to rise, which can flood low-lying areas such as coastal cities, islands, and wetlands. As more ice melts, even more sunlight is absorbed instead of reflected, speeding up the warming process.
            <br><br>
            Warmer oceans also lead to stronger and more dangerous storms, including hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones. These storms cause massive destruction to communities and natural environments. In some parts of the world, extreme heatwaves and droughts are becoming more common, damaging crops, drying up water supplies, and affecting people's health.
